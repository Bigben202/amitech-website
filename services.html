              <p>
              Nowadays, commercial off-the-shelf website themes and and DIY platforms like Squarespace can handle a fair
              amount of small website projects. But when they can’t – because the user base is too complex, content is overwhelming,
               custom integrations / functionality are required, or your brand is mature enough to warrant a custom design solution – we’re a web
                design agency here to help. We’ve delivered dozens of custom, large-scale, technically complex websites for organizations across Canada.

            <h2>User-Centered & Outcome-Driven Website Design & Development</h2>
             <p class="mt-3">
            We’re an Edmonton web design company who designs & builds custom websites for our clients, often on WordPress. The majority of our website
             design & development projects start with a Discovery Phase, wherein we do the requisite research and up-front work required to identify 
             precisely the status of content, and what should be built requirements-wise alongside the approach and effort required.
            
            Following sign-off on the scope of work on the subsequent Design & Build Phase, our clients work with one of our dedicated project teams
             through completion. We work with you in a highly organized and mature agile manner, following Kanban as a methodology. Standing Progress
              Review meetings (usually every two weeks) are used to evaluate work-in-progress with you, allowing us to quickly reprioritize or pivot as
               needed.
            
            Custom web design and development for your new website proceed in tandem, alongside continual QA testing and formalized UA testing at the
             culmination of the Design & Build phase. A dedicated issue resolution period follows content migration/entry, UA and platform training, and 
             on approval we launch your new website. At this stage, we shift into ongoing Managed Web Services for support, hosting (if required), and 
             ongoing feature optimization and development.
            
            We’ve delivered high-value, transformative websites for organizations like the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA), WesTower Communications,
             the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, and many more.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 2em;">“I was so impressed by their project management skills. They use Asana as a project management tool and tracker, and they're
            so easy to communicate with. Everything they did was laid out clearly, and I always knew who was responsible for what. We got 
            weekly status updates with tasks they had completed, the issues they faced, and the information they needed from us. We had a
             phone call twice a week, and they were on top of their project management and timelines. They were top-notch in every respect.”
